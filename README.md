# MySolution

A sample C# WPF solution template that implements MVVM and Clean Architecture.

## Architecture

This solution uses the Clean Architecture pattern which separates the application into three main layers:

- **Core**: Contains the core domain models and interfaces that define the overall architecture of the solution.
- **Infrastructure**: Contains the implementation of the interfaces defined in the core project, as well as any other infrastructure-specific code.
- **Presentation**: Contains the presentation layer, including the views and view models, as well as any other code specific to the WPF application.

## Design Pattern

This solution uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern to separate the presentation logic from the business logic and data access logic.

## Usage

This is just a sample structure, you can use it as a starting point for your own projects, feel free to adapt it to your specific needs.
